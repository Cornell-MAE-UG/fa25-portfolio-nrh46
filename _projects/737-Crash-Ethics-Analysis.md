The Boeing 737 MAX disasters involve two fatal crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019, together claiming 346 lives. The resulting global grounding of the 737 MAX prompted extensive investigations into Boeing’s engineering practices, organizational decision making, and the regulatory framework governing aircraft certification. As a case study, the 737 MAX provides a clear context for examining how ethical responsibilities manifest across different levels of the engineering profession.

At the engineering level, several design and implementation decisions raised ethical concerns when evaluated against ASME Canon 1, which requires engineers to hold the safety, health, and welfare of the public paramount. A key issue was the lack of redundancy in critical sensor inputs, despite redundancy being a well-established principle in critical aerospace systems. Additionally, system behavior and limitations were not thoroughly documented or communicated, constraining the ability of users to respond effectively. While individual engineers may have identified potential risks, the absence of protected reporting pathways limited opportunities to escalate ethical concerns without professional risk.

At the managerial and organizational level, ethical challenges were driven by strong pressure to meet aggressive cost and schedule targets. In response to competition with Airbus, management emphasized rapid certification and minimal changes to pilot training requirements. This environment encouraged design shortcuts and discouraged internal dissent, conflicting with both Canon 1 and Canon 4, which requires engineers and managers to act as faithful agents for their employer while maintaining public trust. Internal culture reportedly prioritized schedule adherence and cost savings, and the outsourcing of portions of software development to temporary workers further weakened quality assurance and accountability.

At the executive, shareholder, and regulatory interface, ethical failures became systemic. Boeing leadership limited transparency with regulators, and following the first crash, did not immediately acknowledge or fully disclose known issues. These actions conflicted with ASME Canon 3, which requires objective and truthful public statements. Shareholder and market pressures incentivized maintaining production continuity and market confidence, while the FAA’s delegation of certification authority to Boeing employees introduced conflicts of interest that reduced independent oversight.

Overall, the 737 MAX disasters demonstrate how ethical lapses can propagate through an engineering organization when safety falls behind cost, schedule, and competitive pressures. As an engineering case study, this project highlights the importance of ethical responsibility at every level—from individual design decisions to executive leadership and regulatory structures—and reinforces the necessity of embedding safety, transparency, and accountability into all stages of engineering practice.
